### Mod 1 Project by Eunjoo Byeon and Paul Torres

This repository contains data collection, cleaning and analyses of the movie data from the past decade (2010 - 2019).  
In addition to BOM, TN, and IMDB data provided by Flatiron, the Movie Database (TMDB) API has been used to complete the dataset. 

# Project

For this project, we aim to analyze the movie trend of past decade to make suggestions in developing a new movie studio brand for a well-established company like Microsoft. We started off with a number of big questions based on our insights, which then we used to guide our process and recommendations.  

# Approach / Questions
1. Understanding the goal
	- What are the main considerations in developing a new movie studio?
		1. **Establishing a sub-brand that matches the existing brand**: "Microsoft doesn't just also make movies. It makes good movies."
		2. **Establishing a long term plan**: Developing a steady long term plan to maximize profit while putting our name out there.
2. Understanding the current market 
	- What types of movies have been yielding highest revenue? 
	- Is there any difference in domestic vs. global market in types of movie people consume? 
	- Is there any change in trend? 
	- What is the reasonable investment to maximize the gain?
	- What other features may influence the sales?
3. Understanding the virality of movies (for building brand)
	- What type of movies or team often get nominated for awards? 
	- How are the popularity measures relate to the profit? 
	- Are there any topical pattern in successful movies?
